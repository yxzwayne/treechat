Open Finder.\n2. Click on the \"Go\" menu in the menu bar at the top of the screen.\n3. Press and hold the Option (Alt) key. You should see the \"Library\" option appear in the dropdown menu.\n4. Click on \"Library\" to open the folder.\n\nNote that the `Library` folder is hidden by default in macOS. If you prefer, you can also access it by using the \"Go to Folder\" option in the \"Go\" menu and typing `~/Library`.\n\nPlease be careful when accessing and modifying files in the `Library` directory, as changing or deleting files could lead to data loss or cause apps to malfunction.",
