## Commits

- Keep the subject short and descriptive; prefixes like `feat:` are fine when they add clarity.

## Pull Requests

- Explain what changed and why.
- Include repro/verification steps; add screenshots/GIFs for UI changes.
- Call out any new env vars, DB/schema impacts, or backward-compat notes.
